# MRCS-QandD-Carbon-Mic-Adapter

## License: Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike

I designed this adapter after working with Lee Nicholas on the phone system for the Utah, Colorado and Western. Lee has a carbon mic in a metal enclosure on a boom
over his CTC machine for the Dispatcher's use.  Lee had also been using my Active Telephone Speech Network (ATSN) for use with a computer headset, powered speaker and a 
footswitch. At one time he wanted to use the ATSN with the carbon mic, but ATSN supports dynamics and Electrets, but ATSN doesn't supply enough current for a carbon mic.
This adapter takes filtered 12V (or any voltage up to 24V with changes to the dropping resistor) and powers a carbon mic. The mic is in paralled with 600:600 isolation
transformer (in series with a 1uF blocking cap) and provides line level audio out.  This audio can feed an ATSN or any line to power amplifier, numerous powered speakers 
and and small amplifier boards are avaialable which will work well with the MRCS-QandD-Carbon-Mic-Adapter.
